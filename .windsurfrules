0. Project is using Expo and best practices.
1. Use absolute imports with path aliases for cleaner code. Create barrel files (index.ts) to simplify imports. Be consistent with export style (named vs default). Use type-only imports when importing just TypeScript types. Avoid deep relative paths.
2. When asked about a specific component, such as FlatList, provide a basic usage example and explain its key props.
3. If the user encounters an error related to 'Cannot read property of undefined', suggest checking for null values in state management or props.
4. Advise the user to use React.memo for functional components that do not need to re-render on every state change.
5. When discussing camera functionality, include how to implement expo-camera and handle permissions.
